Title: Fits my AMC Rambler American perfectly! (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2)
Content: I bought several car covers for my AMC Rambler American, and this one looked like the best option. It initially fit perfectly, but after heavy rain, some water got through the seams. It's not completely waterproof like I expected. The adjustable retaining straps and grommets for anti-theft cable are a great feature, but the instructions for the antenna grommet caused damage to my old antenna. Overall, I'm not completely satisfied with this cover.

Title: Thin but still a good value! (Helpful: 5, Rating: 4)
Content: This cover seems more like layers than it is truly waterproof, but for the price, it's a good value. It fits my car very well and the buckle straps keep it in place. I did experience some leakage through the seams, but I plan to try a waterproof spray to help prevent it. Can't comment on durability yet after only one month.

Title: AMC Rambler American cover fits well, but leaks through seams. (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2)
Content: The Coverland car cover for my AMC Rambler American initially fit perfectly, but it didn't hold up well in heavy rain. Water seeped through the seams, which was disappointing. It does have some useful features like reflectors and windproofing straps, but the leakage issue outweighs the positives.
