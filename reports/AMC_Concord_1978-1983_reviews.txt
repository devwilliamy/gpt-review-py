1. Title: "Not Impressed with the Cover for my AMC Concord (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2)"
   Content: I purchased the Coverland Premium Car Cover for my AMC Concord, but I wasn't impressed with its performance. Despite claiming to be waterproof, water leaked through the seams. I almost returned it, but my husband liked some of its features, so he's going to try using a waterproof spray on the seams to prevent leakage. Can't comment on durability after only one month.
