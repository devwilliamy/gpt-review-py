Title: Not as Waterproof as Expected (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2)
Content: I was disappointed with the level of waterproofing on this car cover. It claimed to be waterproof, but during heavy rain, water seeped through the seams. I almost returned it, but my husband liked the other features, so he's going to try waterproof spray on the seams to help prevent leakage. Can't comment on durability after only one month.

Title: Outstanding Protection and Customer Service (Helpful: 20, Rating: 5)
Content: I have purchased many car covers for my AMC Hornet over the years, but this Coverland Premium Car Cover has been the best. It fits very well, including where the mirrors are, and the zipper entry is a handy feature. The reflectors and straps for windproofing are a nice addition too. The cover proved to be waterproof and easy to put on and secure. I was pleased to find out that I had an extended warranty, and when I contacted the company, they sent me a new cover promptly. The customer service was fast, polite, and professional. Will continue to do business with them.
