Title: Thin (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2)
Content: This cover seems more like layers than being waterproof. It is a good value and fits my car very well. The buckle straps keep it in place. However, it leaks through the seams, and I almost returned it. My husband likes the other features, so he's going to try a waterproof spray on the seams to help prevent leakage. I can't comment on durability after only one month.

Title: Great fit, seems very durable (Helpful: 20, Rating: 5)
Content: This cover fits great and really covers my car. It is waterproof and seems to be holding up well. I believe this will last longer than the Budge covers sold in stores by Walmart. The customer service was terrific when I contacted the company. They were fast, polite, and professional. I have already received a new cover and will continue to do business with them.

Title: Best cover, outstanding customer service (Helpful: 20, Rating: 5)
Content: I have bought many covers for my Jeep, and this cover has been the best. It fits well, proved to be waterproof, and was easy to put on and secure. The only problem was that it only lasted a few months. However, after contacting the company, I found out that I had an extended warranty. I provided a few pictures showing the material deteriorating, and the company sent me a new cover. The customer service was terrific. They were fast, polite, and professional.

Title: Fits my SUV perfectly (Helpful: 15, Rating: 5)
Content: I looked at several car covers for my Hyundai SUV, and this one looked like the best. It fits perfectly, but make sure you use the sizing chart when ordering. However, I learned that it's not completely waterproof in heavy rain. Shortly after putting it on my SUV, we had a severe thunderstorm, and some water did get through, probably through a seam. But I've found that no car covers are completely waterproof, so I guess it should be expected. This particular cover has adjustable retaining straps for the front and back and comes with an extra strap for the midbody to secure the cover under the vehicle. It also comes with grommets for an antitheft cable or bungee cord to keep the cover firmly in place. It also comes with an antenna grommet that you can add and a large nylon drawstring storage bag. One word of caution, if you have a flexible antenna, I followed the instructions for installing the cover which state that it's not necessary to use the antenna grommet if you have a flexible antenna. Well, that didn't work out well because when I removed the cover, my rubber flex antenna was bent and cracked in several places. In retrospect, my car's years old rubber antenna was the original equipment, so the rubber was weathered and hardened. But be aware that you might want to remove any detachable antennas before using this cover. A replacement antenna cost me on Amazon. Other than that, I'm happy with this cover, it's well-made, easy to install, and stayed on my car in MPH winds and heavy rain.

Title: Coverland Premium Car Cover Legitimately a Good Investment of Protection (Helpful: 5, Rating: 5)
Content: I've bought many other brands of car covers in the past, all stating that they are waterproof, but I can truly attest that this Coverland Premium cover does exactly what it states. It provides excellent water protection. I recently had winds over 50 mph, and the cover fitted on my car adheres perfectly without any concerns whatsoever. In comparison to many other car tarp purchases, this brand has certainly lived up well to its rated. I'm truly impressed and satisfied with this car cover purchase. This purchase has proven so far to be one of my best every auto covers over the decades.

Title: Great truck cover (Helpful: 1, Rating: 5)
Content: This cover is waterproof and it's also easy to dry off after rain. I've purchased many truck covers over the years, and this is the best and least expensive truck cover I have ever purchased. The only downside is that it doesn't have mirror pockets.

Title: Almost As Good as Garage (Helpful: 1, Rating: 5)
Content: I'm very pleased with this car cover. It is fully waterproof and relatively easy to remove and replace. The cover adapts to the shape of the vehicle over time, making it easier to use. I wish I had bought one years ago, as I do not have a home garage.

Title: Great fit, stayed on in heavy rain (Helpful: 15, Rating: 5)
Content: I've paid lots of money for custom covers that were a pain to put and keep on my car. It was a breeze to put on, albeit I had to remove the antenna because I didn't want to try my hand at installing the grommet. I trained shortly after installing it and it's really waterproof. The zipper entry on the driver's door is a really great feature.
