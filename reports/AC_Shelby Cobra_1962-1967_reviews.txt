Title: (Helpful: 1, Rating: 2) Not Impressed
Content: I bought the Coverland Premium Car Cover Waterproof All Weather for my Shelby Cobra, but I wasn't impressed. After a heavy rain, water leaked through the seams. I almost returned it, but my husband likes the other features, so he's going to try a waterproof spray on the seams to prevent leakage. Can't comment on durability after only one month.
