Little too big for my classic car but still fits and easy to attach

=======================================================================
I got this so I didn't have to scrape the ice off my car and it's a pretty wise idea especially in the morning. Could fit my car better but the straps do their jobs.
=======================================================================
It's fully waterproof so it doesn't breath but on the flip side, it means that it keeps the car dry if it is dry when you put it on. For the price, I'm surprised by the quality, feel, and thickness. I now have 2 covers and will be getting at least one more, maybe 2 so all the outside cars can be covered.


=======================================================================
This cover is really good against wind and other things, but this cober is not waterproof. If can protevt from a light drizzle but in heavy rain the water sill seep through. I would recommend to have another cover underneath to protect from rain.
=======================================================================
Serves it purpose. Pleased for money sent

This car cover worked really well. It did start to get sun fade. Not a big deal as it worked for what I needed it for. The design was nice and sleek. I put this on my car by myself so it was easy to put on. It held up to high winds as well. Iâ€™d recommend this product.

=======================================================================
This item looks nice. Covers the car completely. But, its description says waterproof. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!! Even the night fog goes thru and leaves the car looking messy with a bit of dust and water all over it.


=======================================================================
Works okay but it did rip when a twig fell on my car

This car cover can be used while your vehicle has be outside while your garage is being cleaned out.
Don't let your car get damaged by the weather outside - rain or snow.

Literally withstood a category 4 hurricane that destroyed a lot of our town. Straps held strong, kept the car dry in rain that was defying gravity. Would gosh dang recommend to anyone
