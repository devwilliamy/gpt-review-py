Here are some amazon reviews

Can you generate some new ones

Bought the small convertible one for use with my 1987 Honda CRX and it fits perfectly. Covers every part of the car, and is a bit long but not long enough to be an issue. The straps are flimsy and one clip came damaged, but I really needed the cover so it just adapted it with some homemade stuff. Truly waterproof and sturdy for the price.

==================================================================
Nice fit, multiple straps to secure cover from blowing off. I use it to keep frost off only, did not try to keep ice off the car. Has reflection sections to keep vehicle visible if street parked.

==================================================================
Great price! Quality of cover is MUCH better than expected at this price.

Problem: The fasteners on the front part of the cover aren‚Äôt the same size. Front clips don‚Äôt fit together, so you can‚Äôt snap them together to secure the cover on the boat.

Back fasteners fit together perfectly. Obviously a manufacturing error with the front clips.

If the wind is always at your back, you‚Äôre golden ‚Ä¶ OR ‚Äî you can tie the front two tie-downs together instead of using the fasteners. Works for me. :)

Side Note: Plastic Fasteners eventually break/warp anyway ‚Äî in any kind of weather.

Everything about this product is great. Some things to keep handy when using this for snow freezing weather is: 1-2 construction bags for storage, grip gloves, ski mask. The bag that comes with it you can store when no longer using it, but when your taking it off/on your car you'll want the construction bag to stay in your car. It's going to take a few minutes getting it off and on so keep gloves in your car that you can use to put it on. The straps are tiny but sturdy, there three straps front middle and back that clip to opposite side. Ski mask when it's snowing and windy and your taking it off the snow will hit your face, stay warm, drive slow and keep lights on for young and elderly to see you on the roads stay safe everyone!üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

I bought this cover in December 2020 and it lasted until August 2021 sitting out in the elements 24/7 for those 8 months. One day it just decided it had had enough and basically ripped in half. I plan to buy another one of these but I decided to read reviews (because that's what I like to do for entertainment) before re-ordering. The biggest complaints I've see is "it's not waterproof" and "for the money I spent blah blah blah".

First of all, this is a budget car cover at it's $37 price point and you aren't going to find one that cheap at your local parts store unless it's on sale. The $40+ car covers sold at auto parts stores are not waterproof and will shred apart or blow away with the slightest wind. This car cover at least has 3 straps built-in that will hold it in place so it's definitely not blowing away.

Second, I can't attest for the waterproof aspect of it and while I understand that the description says it's waterproof, even if it's not I have to point back to the price again. What did you think you were getting for $37? If your vehicle needs to be protected from the rain that bad, you may want to consider a garage or storage. If that isn't an option then you're looking at spending $100+ for a car cover that's going to stand up to all of the elements for any extended period of time. I've had a 1991 Firebird that I've kept covered outdoors for 5+ years and I've bought probably 4 or 5 different brand car covers in this price range. There's one things consistent amongst them all ..... they're only going to last you about 8-12 months tops. That's just how it goes when you buy a budget car cover.

year it's far cheaper than paying for a storage unit to put the car in.

UPDATE: The 4th cover lasted 4 months. I might start buying these 2 at a time especially when they're on sale. Right now they're only $22 which is actually closer to what I'd like to pay for these regularly. Still can't complain about a $20-$30 car cover that lasts a few months. I couldn't get a storage unit this cheap to store it in.

UPDATE: My 5th cover lasted 5 months. At this point, I'm just updating this review for research purposes.

My sons car has a leak in either sunroof or windshield that allows water into his car which shorts out the electrical system and floods floorboard. He has been covering his car with a large tarp for awhile now and it has been hard for him to keep it down in strong winds (not to mention looked kinda sad/bad). This car cover is a game changer for him, it's very easy to put on and remove. It has a strong elastic band at both the front and rear end and three straps that go under the car and clip to keep cover in place snugly. It comes in a drawstring bag for storage. Added bonus is that it looks great compared to the old tarp with bricks, went from trashy to classy for just $25.00.

==================================================================
Considering the wind was blowing it was fairly easy to put on my car by myself.Just had to weight it down on back until I could get car covered with it.Straps will be extra security.We see in morning if it stays on!!Really lightweight and easy to handle

==================================================================
The MORNYRAY Waterproof Car Cover offers decent protection for my sedan, especially against rain and snow. However, one significant drawback is its vulnerability to strong winds.

While the cover fits my car well and keeps it dry in wet conditions, it often gets blown around by the wind. Even with the windproof design, it struggles to stay in place during gusty weather. This can be quite frustrating as I've had to readjust it multiple times.

I appreciate the UV protection and the quality of the material, which seems durable. The blue color looks nice, and it's relatively easy to put on and take off.

In summary, if you live in a windy area, be prepared for some challenges with this cover. It does offer good protection, but its wind resistance leaves something to be desired. You can just put weights on it and you're good to go. If wind is not a major concern for you, it might still be a reasonable choice for the price.

==================================================================
Satisfied with purchase. Fit snug on an el Camino. It seems like the material of a tent, but not as thin. Will be purchasing another for another vehicle. Appreciate

This car cover is fairly easy to install and with the wind proof straps it works perfectly for my car where it is quite windy. I bought this as it is quite foggy where I live in the morning and the eucalyptus tree above where I park likes to leave brown residue on my car when that happens. This does do it it‚Äôs job well at preventing that. That being said, I find that this car cover is mainly water resistant and not waterproof as when it rains it still is soaking wet through the car cover. I would probably avoid using this if you want to keep water off your car if it is leaky or if you want to protect the paint from water. This is probably better suited for garaged cars. But with the outdoor use I get from this, this is more than adequate for what I need from this car cover and I‚Äôd recommend it.
